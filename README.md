## ALCOHOL INTAKE AND SLEEP DURATION AMONGST US ARMED FORCES VETERANS IN 2016 (BRFSS)

### Objective
This study sought to identify if there was an association between alcohol intake and sleep duration in the United States Armed Forces 
veterans using the data obtained from the BRFSS 2016 database. 

### Method
This is a cross-sectional study based on the data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS, 2016). 
Veterans and the various categories were identified based on specific questions asked in the survey. 
Data extraction, sub-setting, analysis  and development of linear regression models was accomplished 
using various R packages in the R studio

### Results
Out of 486303 individuals who were involved in the BRFSS data collection in 2016, the veteran subpopulation who had a 
valid response for sleep duration and alcohol intake was identified to contain 60109 (12.3%) individuals who were further 
classified into monthly, weekly and non-drinkers. Descriptive analysis and linear regression models were developed to check for
an association between these variables and other confounders associated with sleep duration in humans. 
The observations and findings were presented using tables and plots.

### Conclusion
From the data analysis, there was no strong association shown between alcohol drinking (monthly and weekly) 
and sleep duration based on the final multiple regression model of the BRFSS data. Other confounding variables such as age, 
binge drinking, exercise status, and poor health showed a significant relationship with sleep duration.
